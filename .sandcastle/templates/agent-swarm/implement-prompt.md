# TASK

Fix issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull in the issue using `gh issue view`, with comments. If it has a parent PRD, pull that in too.

Only work on the issue specified.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. Make commits and run tests.

# CREDENTIALS

`gh` is already authenticated in this sandbox via the `GH_TOKEN` env var. Call
it directly: `gh issue view`, `gh issue comment`, `gh pr view`, etc. Never
prefix a `gh` invocation with `GH_TOKEN=… gh …` or echo the token in any shell
command — log files capture stdin/stdout and a leaked credential is a real
incident.

# CONTEXT

If you need recent commit history to orient yourself, run `git log -n 10 --oneline` yourself. Don't run it speculatively.

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Pay extra attention to test files that touch the relevant parts of the code.

# EXECUTION

If applicable, use RGR to complete the task.

1. RED: write one test
2. GREEN: write the implementation to pass that test
3. REPEAT until done
4. REFACTOR the code

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` to ensure the tests pass.

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

If the task is not complete, leave a comment on the GitHub issue with what was done.

Do not close the issue - this will be done later.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.


Learnings:
- When friction worth remembering appears, emit an inline tag exactly as `<learning>[Friction Type] note</learning>`.
- Use Title Case bracket prefixes (for example `[PRD Misinformation]`, `[Scope Drift]`, `[Tooling Friction]`).
- If no existing type fits, invent a new Friction Type bracket.
- Emit zero or many learning tags as needed; do not emit empty filler tags.
